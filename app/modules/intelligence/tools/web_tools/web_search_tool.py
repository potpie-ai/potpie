  ðŸ“Œ Use cases:
  - When user queries reference APIs, frameworks, or libraries not found in the codebase.
  - For understanding unfamiliar technologies, services, or vendors mentioned in the codebase.
  - To research public company documentation, changelogs, or ecosystem developments.
  - To supplement an agent's lack of training on new LLMs, SDKs, or APIs introduced after 2023.

  ðŸ§  Tips for forming good queries:
  - Be descriptive and specific: include context, technologies, dates, and desired insights.
  - Frame queries as complete questions or short paragraphs.
  - Include what you're trying to understand, not just keywords.

  âœ… Example of an effective query:
  {
      "query": "What is Potpie.ai? Which websites have reviewed it recently and what features are highlighted by partners or reviewers?"
  }

  ðŸ“¦ Returns:
  - 'content': Rich, paragraph-style answer based on recent web results.
  - 'citations': List of source URLs referenced.
  - 'success': Whether the search and response were successful.
