## FAQs

### What is the difference between the ENV and the isDevelopmentMode environment variables ? 
`ENV` signifies the environment the app is running in, 
signfying configuration to load in dev / stage or prod env.

`isDevelopmentMode` tells the app that it can run without dependencies such as firebase, GitHub configuration etc.

The `ENV=development` still needs firebase / gcp / GitHub etc because it simply is about running potpie's backend locally. 
But `isDevelopmentMode=enabled` disables all these to bring in support for running without most dependencies and support local parsing for example.
