"""Reconciliation batch repository (port).

Producers call ``upsert_open_batch_for_pot`` to coalesce an event into the
pot's open ``pending`` batch (creating one if none exists). The host queue
adapter then enqueues a worker job for that batch id; the worker calls
``claim_batch_by_id`` to atomically transition the row to ``claimed`` and
invoke the agent.

        ``older_than_seconds`` is compared against ``claimed_at`` using the
